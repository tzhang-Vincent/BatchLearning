# BatchLearning
Adaptive Motor Monitoring System Based on Machine Learning Batch Training

Zhang Ting works as a project manager

Project Description:

1. University-enterprise cooperative project with CyberInsight Technology

2. Implemented batch training to realize abnormal detection for different motor within cyber-physical system

3. Realized edge online training on using Self-Organizing Map algorithm and motor vibration signal processing algorithm embedded in Raspberry Pi to overcome time-consuming and unsafe caused by traditional cloud one-time training

4. Realized server frame building in Python and its interaction with Web UI written in html and javascripts
